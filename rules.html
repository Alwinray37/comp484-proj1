                Volleyball is a fast-paced sport with a clear structure. Whether you're
                watching for the first time or stepping onto the court, understanding the
                rules makes all the difference.
            </p>
            <p>A volleyball match is divided into sets, and each set is a race to reach a target score.</p>

                <h4>Sets &amp; Winning a Match</h4>
                <p>
                    Most matches are played as a best-of-five sets format. The first team to
                    win three sets wins the match. In shorter competitions, a best-of-three
                    format (first to two sets) is also common.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="rule-section">
                <h4>How Sets Are Scored</h4>
                <p>
                    Sets 1 through 4 are played to <strong>25 points</strong>, and a team must
                    win by at least 2 points. If the score reaches 24–24, play continues until
                    one team leads by two. If a fifth (deciding) set is needed, it is played to
                    only <strong>15 points</strong>, again with a 2-point margin required to win.

                <h4>Rally Scoring</h4>
                <p>Modern volleyball uses rally scoring, which means every single rally results in a point — no matter who served.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="rule-section">
                <h4>How It Works</h4>
                <p>
                    A rally begins with a serve and ends when the ball touches the floor, goes
                    out of bounds, or a team commits a fault. Whichever team wins the rally
                    earns one point and the right to serve next. This system keeps the game
                    moving quickly and ensures every play matters.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="rule-section">
                <h4>Serving Order &amp; Rotation</h4>
                <p>
                    When a team wins back the serve from the opponent, all six of its players
                    rotate one position clockwise before the next serve. This ensures every
                    player takes a turn serving and playing in each position on the court.
                    Serving out of order results in a fault and loss of the point.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="rule-section">
                <h4>Core Rules of Play</h4>
                <p>These are the fundamental rules that govern every rally in indoor volleyball.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="rule-section">
                <h4>The Three-Hit Rule</h4>
                <p>
                    Each team is allowed a maximum of <strong>three contacts</strong> with the ball
                    before sending it over the net. A typical sequence is a pass (bump), a set,
                    and then an attack (spike). A block touch does not count as one of the three
                    contacts.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="rule-section">
                <h4>Legal Contacts</h4>
                <p>
                    Players may use any part of their body to contact the ball. The ball must be
                    hit cleanly — it cannot be caught, held, or carried. Double contacts (hitting
                    the ball twice in a row with one motion) are illegal, except on a first contact
                    when the ball arrives with force (such as on a serve receive or a hard spike).
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="rule-section">
                <h4>Net &amp; Boundary Rules</h4>
                <p>
                    Players may not touch the net during play. The ball is considered in-bounds if
                    it lands on or inside the boundary lines. Players may reach over the net to
                    block a ball, but only after the attacking team has made their final contact.
                    The ball may also be played off the net and remain in play.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="rule-section">
                <h4>Serving Rules</h4>
                <p>
                    The server must stand behind the end line when serving. The serve may be
                    underhand or overhand, and jump serves are also allowed. The serve must clear
                    the net without being touched by a teammate. If the serve hits the net but
                    still lands in-bounds, it is legal and play continues (a "net serve").

            <section class="rule-section">
                <h4>Common Faults</h4>
                <p>A fault results in the opposing team winning the rally and earning a point.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="rule-section">
                <h4>Faults That End a Rally</h4>
                <p>
                    The most common faults in volleyball include: hitting the ball out of bounds,
                    failing to send the ball over the net, a player touching the net, a team
                    using more than three contacts, a player committing a double hit (outside of
                    a first-contact exception), and a player crossing under the net and interfering
                    with the opponent. Foot faults on the serve — stepping on or over the end line
                    before contact — are also called regularly.

                <h4>Timeouts &amp; Substitutions</h4>
                <p>Teams have limited opportunities to regroup and make changes during a set.</p>

            <section class="rule-section">
                <h4>Timeouts</h4>
                <p>
                    Each team is allowed <strong>two timeouts per set</strong>, each lasting 30
                    seconds. Coaches use timeouts to adjust strategy, break an opponent's momentum,
                    or give players a brief rest. In televised matches, additional technical
                    timeouts may be called automatically at set score milestones.

            <section class="rule-section">
                <h4>Substitutions</h4>
                <p>
                    Teams are allowed up to <strong>six substitutions per set</strong>. A player
                    who is substituted out may return, but only in the same position they left.
                    The libero — a specialized defensive player — is subject to separate
                    substitution rules and may freely rotate in and out for back-row players
                    without using the team's substitution limit.
