                    The biggest difference between beach and indoor volleyball is the number of players on each team. Indoor volleyball is played with 6 players on each team, while beach volleyball is played with only 2 players on each team. This means that beach volleyball requires a lot more versatility and athleticism from its players, as they have to cover a much larger area of the court and perform a wider range of skills. Additionally, beach volleyball is played on sand, which can make it more difficult to move around and jump compared to the hard court used in indoor volleyball. The rules of beach volleyball are also slightly different from indoor volleyball, with some variations in scoring and serving rules. Overall, both beach and indoor volleyball are exciting and challenging sports that require skill, teamwork, and strategy to succeed.

                <h3>Key Differences</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Number of Players:</strong> Indoor volleyball is played with 6 players on each team, while beach volleyball is played with only 2 players on each team.</li>
                    <li><strong>Playing Surface:</strong> Beach volleyball is played on sand, while indoor volleyball is played on a hard court.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Rules:</strong> The rules of beach volleyball are slightly different from indoor volleyball, with some variations in scoring. For example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Beach volleyball uses a 21-point system instead of 25 points in indoor volleyball.</li>
                            <li>Setting – the overhand action of passing the ball to a teammate to set up an attack, is a lot stricter in beach volleyball than in indoor volleyball.</li>
                            <li>Block touches count as a touch in beach, which means that if the blocker touches the ball during a block and the ball stays on their side of the court, they only have two more touches to return the ball.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
