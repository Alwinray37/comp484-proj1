                    Volleyball is a popular team sport that is played both indoors and on the beach. It was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan, who wanted to create a new game that combined elements of basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball. The game quickly gained popularity and is now played by millions of people around the world.

                <h3>Basics of volleyball</h3>
                <p>When people think of volleyball, they often think of indoor volleyball which is more structured and competitive. Indoor volleyball is played on a hard court with a net. There are other forms of volleyball such as beach volleyball, which is played on sand with fewer rules and more flexibility in gameplay. Other popular variations of volleyball is grass volleyball, which is played on a grass court and is often seen in recreational settings, and 9-man volleyball, which is played with 9 players per team and is often seen in youth and recreational leagues and gaining popularity fast.</p>
                <p>Here are the basic rules of volleyball:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The objective is to send the ball over the net and make it land on the opponent's side.</li>
                    <li>Each team is allowed up to 3 touches to return the ball.</li>
                    <li>A point is scored when the ball hits the ground on the opponent's side or when an opponent makes an error.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are far more complicated rules and strategies in volleyball that we will not cover in this project, but understanding these basics is a great starting point for anyone interested in learning more about the sport.</p>
